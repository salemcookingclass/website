  feedback: `The depth of each session in the 5 days workshop was amazing and Ramya mam was quite cautious about the nuances. 
  Being a beginner, my confidence in baking wasn't that much but through the knowledge shared and hands on experience in the workshop i felt I will be able to explore baking further more.
Ramya mam took ample amount of time to clarify the doubts after each session, each recipe was dealt with utmost attention and there were sufficient tools provided to execute the desired outcome.
The ambience was quiet and supportive with no disturbances.
A big thank you to Ramya mam for organising such sessions and being supportive throughout which helped me to build confidence and it was a boost to my passion towards baking.
I would definitely love to come back to her classes in future as well, such a reliable coach.`
